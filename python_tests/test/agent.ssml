  Hi Thomas, thanks for calling.

  You're saying the alarm is triggering even though the temperature is within the expected range?
  <!-- Now at offset 12 seconds -->

  I will continue talking for a bit longer just to check how it works with semantic voice activity detection.
  <!-- Now at offset 19 seconds -->
  <break time="3s"/>
  Got it.
  <!-- Now at offset 23 seconds -->
  <break time="2s"/>
  Let me pull up the logs...
  <!-- Now at offset 27 seconds -->
  <break time="5s"/>
  Okay, I see repeated alerts for unit FZ-MJ-3, starting around six thirty this morning.
  <!-- Now at offset 38 seconds -->
  <break time="1s"/>
  And you mentioned restarting—did you power-cycle just the sensor or the whole controller?
  <!-- Now at offset 44 seconds -->
  <break time="10s"/>
  Understood.
  <!-- Now at offset 55 seconds -->
  <break time="2s"/>
  It might be a drift issue.
  I’ll disable auto-escalation for this unit temporarily.
  <!-- Now at offset 63 seconds -->
  <break time="10s"/>
  Can you send me a photo of the display on the controller?
  <!-- Now at offset 76 seconds -->
  <break time="11s"/>
  Received.
  <!-- Now at offset 87 seconds -->
  <break time="2s"/>
  Thanks.
  I see the internal reading says minus twelve point seven degrees Celsius,
  which doesn't match your probe.
  <!-- Now at offset 96 seconds -->
  <break time="10s"/>
  Yes, I’ll send you a replacement sensor.
  In the meantime, I’ll flag this unit to ignore alerts below minus ten degrees until tomorrow.
  <!-- Now at offset 115 seconds -->
  <break time="10s"/>
  You're welcome, Thomas.
  Have a good day.
