# AudioInterceptor Implementation Summary

## Problem 1: Audio Mixing/Replacement Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Added State Tracking Variables**:
   - `#callerTranslationActive: boolean` - Tracks if caller translation is in progress
   - `#agentTranslationActive: boolean` - Tracks if agent translation is in progress
   - `#callerActiveResponseId?: string` - Tracks active caller response ID
   - `#agentActiveResponseId?: string` - Tracks active agent response ID

2. **Modified Audio Forwarding Logic**:
   - `translateAndForwardAgentAudio()`: Only forwards untranslated audio when `!this.#agentTranslationActive`
   - `translateAndForwardCallerAudio()`: Only forwards untranslated audio when `!this.#callerTranslationActive`

3. **Enhanced OpenAI Message Handlers**:
   - **Caller Socket**: 
     - `response.created` → Sets `#callerTranslationActive = true`
     - `response.done` or `response.audio.done` → Sets `#callerTranslationActive = false`
   - **Agent Socket**:
     - `response.created` → Sets `#agentTranslationActive = true`
     - `response.done` or `response.audio.done` → Sets `#agentTranslationActive = false`

4. **Updated OpenAI Message Type**:
   - Added optional `response?: { id: string }` field to track response IDs
   - Made `delta` optional since not all messages contain audio data

### How It Works

1. **Normal Operation** (no translation active):
   - When `FORWARD_AUDIO_BEFORE_TRANSLATION=true`, untranslated audio flows through immediately
   - Audio is also sent to OpenAI for translation

2. **Translation Active**:
   - When OpenAI sends `response.created`, translation state becomes active
   - Untranslated audio forwarding is blocked
   - Only translated audio from OpenAI is forwarded

3. **Translation Complete**:
   - When OpenAI sends `response.done` or `response.audio.done`, translation state becomes inactive
   - Untranslated audio forwarding resumes

## Problem 2: Audio Alignment and Stuttering Solution

### Changes Made

1. **New Method: `sendAlignedAudio()`**:
   - Replaces direct `socket.send()` calls for audio
   - Applies frame alignment before sending
   - Includes error handling with fallback

2. **New Method: `alignAudioFrames()`**:
   - Aligns G.711 μ-law audio to 8-byte boundaries
   - Prevents audio artifacts from misaligned frames
   - Handles edge cases (empty/small buffers)

3. **Updated Audio Sending**:
   - All audio (translated and untranslated) now uses `sendAlignedAudio()`
   - Consistent timing and alignment across all audio paths

### Technical Details

- **G.711 μ-law Format**: 8kHz sample rate, 8-bit samples, 1 byte per sample
- **Frame Alignment**: Aligns to 8-byte boundaries for optimal performance
- **Error Handling**: Falls back to original audio if alignment fails
- **Logging**: Debug logs for audio chunk sizes and timestamps

## Integration Points

### State Management
- State is reset in `close()` method
- Translation state is tracked per direction (caller ↔ agent)
- Robust error handling prevents state corruption

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes are additive - no breaking changes
- Fallback mechanisms ensure operation continues if new features fail
- Original behavior preserved when `FORWARD_AUDIO_BEFORE_TRANSLATION=false`

## Expected Benefits

### Problem 1 Resolution
- **No More Duplicate Audio**: Only one audio stream (original OR translated) plays at a time
- **Seamless Switching**: Clean transitions between untranslated and translated audio
- **Proper Timing**: Translation state prevents audio overlap

### Problem 2 Resolution
- **Reduced Stuttering**: Frame alignment prevents audio artifacts
- **Consistent Quality**: All audio paths use the same alignment logic
- **Better Performance**: Optimized frame boundaries improve audio processing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with `FORWARD_AUDIO_BEFORE_TRANSLATION=true`**:
   - Verify no duplicate audio during translation
   - Check smooth transitions between modes

2. **Test Audio Quality**:
   - Listen for reduced stuttering/clicking
   - Verify audio clarity during transitions

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Very short audio chunks
   - Network interruptions during translation
   - Rapid speech transitions

4. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Check for "translation started/completed" messages
   - Verify audio alignment debug logs
   - Watch for any error fallbacks
